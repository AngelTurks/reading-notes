# why should you use const instead of var?

using const instead of var is a good practice to create more robust and maintainable code, particularly when you want to indicate that a variable should not be reassigned. However, it's essential to consider the context and requirements of your specific code when choosing which type of variable declaration to use.

## How to change a car tire?

-  Find a Safe Location: If you experience a flat tire while driving, pull over to a safe location away from traffic. Choose a flat and level surface, like the side of the road or a parking lot. Turn on your hazard lights to alert other drivers.

-  Gather Necessary Tools: Typically, your car should come with a spare tire, a car jack, and a lug wrench. Locate these tools in your vehicle before starting the tire change.
-   Loosen Lug Nuts: Before jacking up the car, use the lug wrench to loosen the lug nuts on the flat tire. Do not remove them completely at this point, just break their initial tightness.
-  Position the Jack: Refer to your car's owner's manual for the proper lifting points. Typically, these are located along the frame of the car. Place the jack securely under the vehicle and ensure it contacts a sturdy part of the frame.
-  Lift the Car: Pump the jack handle until the car is high enough off the ground for the flat tire to clear the surface. Make sure the car is stable and secure before proceeding.
-  remove the Lug Nuts: Now that the car is lifted, you can fully remove the lug nuts from the flat tire and take the tire off the car.
-  Install the Spare Tire: Lift the spare tire and align it with the lug bolt holes on the car. Push it gently onto the bolts until it fits snugly.
-  Hand-Tighten Lug Nuts: Start threading the lug nuts onto the bolts by hand. Make sure they are all tightened evenly to avoid any misalignment.
-  Lower the Car: Carefully lower the car back to the ground using the jack.
-  Fully Tighten Lug Nuts: Once the car is on the ground, use the lug wrench to fully tighten the lug nuts in a star or cross pattern. This ensures even pressure and a secure fit.
-  Check the Tire Pressure: After changing the tire, check the spare tire's pressure to ensure it is safe to drive on. If the pressure is low, inflate it to the recommended level.
-  Put Away Tools and Flat Tire: Return the jack, lug wrench, and flat tire to their designated locations in your car.
-  Get the Flat Tire Repaired or Replaced: Spare tires are temporary and not designed for extended use. Get your flat tire repaired or replaced as soon as possible.
