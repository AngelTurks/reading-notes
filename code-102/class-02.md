# What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

Four important features to look for in a text editor are code completion, syntax highlighting, a nice variety of themes to reduce eye strain and fatigue, and the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.

## What do the following commands do?
1. pwd
2. ls
3. cd
4. mkdir
5. touch

1. pwd stands for Print Working Directory. It tells you what your current or present working directory is.
2. ls is short for list, it will just do a plain listing of our current location.
3. cd stands for change directory, which is how we move around in the system.
4. mkdir stands for make directory, which is how we create a directory.
5. touch is a command we use to modify the access and modification times on a file.

## Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)
1. cd projects
2. mkdir new-project
3. touch new-project/newfile.md
4. cd ..
5. ls projects/new-project

1. cd projects will change between projects.
2. mkdir new-project will make a directory name new-projects.
3. touch new-project/newfile.md will access that file.
4. cd .. will change which directory we are in.
5. ls projects/new-project will list out the files in that directory.
